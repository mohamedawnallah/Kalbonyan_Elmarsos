### E-commerce App

📌 Request -> Node Js Server -> File-based data store

📌 File-based data store -> Nodejs Server -> HTML Doc

📌 Project Setup:
    1. Create a new Project Directory
    2. Generate a package.json file
    3. Install a few dependencies to help us write our project
    4. Create a 'start' script to run our project

📌 npm run <script>

📌 Express allow us to set up a full-featured web server that can receive network requests and respond to them (The same as Node Js Standard Library Server but there are more features and edge cases included)

📌 Route Handlers

📌 When we enter a url in a browser our browser formulating a network request Its components:
-`host`
-`Port`
-`Path`
-`Method`
    To Your Operating System then to Network devices e.g NIC
    , To DNS Server (Host Name, IP Address) If it is host
    , That means me (local computer) Ports on your computer 
        you can have many websevers 
    , Operating system runs website whatever its port is
    , Express Listens to that port and It cares about HTTP Request not all matter but `PATH`, `METHOD`
    , Router Object has multiple router handlers 
     
📌 Automatic Submission, Looking for Input Elements Into Form and collect all names values from form 

📌 When we make a form request method type with POST request it is appended into request body instead of url bar

📌 Buffer is an array of raw information in javascript

📌 You can get form data that is embededd into body Manually but It will be a repetitive task and don't achieve DRY Principle

📌 Middle Ware Function is a function that does some pre-processing on the `req` and `res` objects that is utimately usable through Express

📌 Express created before promises .

📌 next callback function means all the processing is done

📌 req object has access to method 

📌 Globally Applying Middlewares

📌 Express server interfaces with Data storage for storing users and products list by storing it on the hardware 
users.json
products.json

📌 - Will error if we try to ope/write the same file twitce at the same time
   - Won't work if we have multiple servers running on different machines
   - We have to write to the FS everytime we want to update some data

📌 In Server Design and data management There are two main approaches for managing data:
1.Repository Approach
    - A single class (repository) is responsible for data access
       All records are stored and used as a  plain JS object
2.Active Record Approach
    - Every Record is an instance of a model class that has its own methods to CRUD operations

📌 The PlainObject type is a JavaScript object containing zero or more key-value pairs. 

📌 Better Json Formatting using JSON.stringify(<records>, null, <indentation-levels>)

📌 toString('hex') In a String Hex Format

📌 SignUp Validation Logic 

📌 Cookies are very small string of characters That servers want the browser to store

📌 Request Cookies

📌 Cookies are in encrypted format

📌 Cookies Based Authentication

📌 Dealing With COOKIES using cookie-session npm library

📌 Signing out the user

📌 Password Hashing Algorithm

📌 It IS NEVER Now to take the output of Hashing Algorithm, injecting it through Hashing Algorithm, and give you the same input earlier

📌 Rainbow Table Attack

📌 Salt is a random string of characters that is going to prevent the user from giving us a password that is too common

📌 Salting + Hashing Passwords

📌 Project Structure will be divided into Routes, Repositories, and Views Directory

📌 Adding Better Form Validation

📌 An express.js middleware for validator.s

📌 Validation vs Sanitization

📌 Sanitization modifies each field in place applying each of sanitizers in the order they were specified
